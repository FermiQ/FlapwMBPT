As my new assignments at BNL are taking me away from the development of principal parts of FlapwMBPT (GW and GW+Vertex),
I am placing the support of this package on hold because of insufficiency of time for doing that and to avoid creation of bugs in the code.
Anyone who possibly is still interested in the package can reach me at akutepov@bnl.gov for inquiring about the state of the package.
